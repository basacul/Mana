# Mana
Mana is a web application for the healthcare system that allows healthcare service providers, patients and insurance companies to securely exchange and manage data in the Mana ecosystem. Mana runs on top of ethereum and uses smart contracts to handle the logic on how data is accessed and exchanged based on the authorization given by the data owner. Thid application gives the patient the tools to retrieve medical data generated by healthcare service providers and manage a holistic electronic healthcare record. The patient can choose what aspects of his or her record to share that can be withdrawn at any moment.

In addition, Mana allows users to store sensitive data outside of the ethereum network such that this data is not available in the ethereum network. A messaging service for users in the ecosystem allows to communicate with healthcare service providers, insurance companies and other patients.

The goal of Mana is to provide a secure distributed data exchange grid for the healthcare sector by minimizing the investment in new IT infrastructure and providing a tool to accelerate the digital adoption in the healthcare system. 

This application uses mongodb, express, nodejs and ethereum. MetaMask - for now - is needed as a wallet to use the features given by the ethereum network. The frontend uses html5, css3 with bootstrap v4.3.1, and finally javascript using jQuery for bootstrap, web3.js injected by MetaMask and vanilla javascript - a fancy name for plain javascript without any additional libraries.

## Structure
The web application uses ejs to display the following sites that are accessible through the navigation bar at the top starting with the logo from left to right:

* __home.ejs__: **LOGO** Site welcomes the user that is rendered only by clicking the Mana logo
* __e-record.ejs__: **E-Record** Site manages the data available through the ethereum network 
* __tools.ejs__: **Tools** Site manages the settings concerning the ethereum network
* __account.ejs__: **My Account** Site manage the account settings concerning the web application
* __messages.ejs__: **Messages** Site providing the messaging service
* __personal.ejs__: **Personal** Site manages data stored outside the ethereum network
* __contact.ejs__: **Help/Contact Us** Site with contact information and form
* __faq.ejs__: **Help/FAQ** Site with faq
* __documentation.ejs__: **Help/Documentation** Site with documentation for the web application
* __login.ejs__: **Checkout** Logs the user out and sends the user back to the login page

This web application is under construction currently in version 2.0.0 and will be live on July 31 2019 at [Openhealth.care](http://openhealth.care/).
