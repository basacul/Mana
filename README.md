# Mana
A blockchain application for the healthcare sector to facilitate the settlement of bills between healthcare providers and insurance companies.
This solution would apply on current healthcare systems in Europe, especially Switzerland and Germany.  

The name for this project will be Mana coming from the Polynesian belief, that Mana is an impersonal supernatural power which can be transmitted or inherited. And well, power will be transmitted in form of money, which may be regarded as supernatural power. In other words, Mana suits this purpose very well.
