# Mana
A distributed ledger technology (dlt) prototype application for the healthcare sector. This prototype is built along my bachelor thesis with the title "Secure Data Exchange Using Distributed Ledger Technologies". The goal of this prototype: Is a secure data exchange between two parties possible using a dlt? 

The [synopsis](https://github.com/basacul/Mana/blob/master/documents/Secure_Data_Exchange_Using_Distributed_Ledger_Technologies_Version_0_7.pdf) for my bachelor thesis explains my personal motivation, related systems and works as well as the schedule for this project.


The name for this project will be Mana coming from the Polynesian belief, that Mana is an impersonal supernatural power which can be transmitted or inherited.
