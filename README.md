# Mana
A distributed ledger technology (dlt) prototype application for the healthcare sector. This prototype is built along my bachelor thesis with the title "Secure Data Exchange Using Distributed Ledger Technologies". The goal of this prototype: Is a secure data exchange between two parties possible using a dlt? 

The frontend is built using html5, css and javascript. With the library web3.js methods are provided to access the ethereum network. The backend is built using solidity to write the smart contracts necessary to perform the data exchange through the ethereum network. In order to save some money, ganache is used to run a local ethereum network with a given set of users already possessing the necessary amount to perform computations on the network. The prototype will go live on July 31 2019 at [Openhealth](http://openhealth.care).

The [frontend application](https://github.com/basacul/Mana/blob/master/dapp/app.js) is based on web technologies using expressjs as framework and web3.js. The features of the application Mana are progressively enhanced with html5, css3 and plain javascript along the many iterations. 

The [synopsis](https://github.com/basacul/Mana/blob/master/documents/Secure_Data_Exchange_Using_Distributed_Ledger_Technologies_Version_0_8.pdf) of my bachelor thesis explains my personal motivation, related systems and works as well as the schedule for this project.


The name for this project will be Mana coming from the Polynesian belief, that Mana is an impersonal supernatural power which can be transmitted or inherited.
